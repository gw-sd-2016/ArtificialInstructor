						The Artificial Instructor is a program designed to help people learn how to play the Bass guitar. Today people may learn to play the Bass guitar by either using a private instructor or a series of textbooks and online tutorial videos. My program aims to give the benefits of both methods of teaching by allowing feedback on the user's real time input. Using the TarsosDSP library and the JavaSound API my program is able to interpret input, compare to the lesson data, and give feedback on attempts.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am graduating this year, 2016, at the George Washington University in the School of Enginnering and Applied Science with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My technical track is computer security and my non-technical track is pre-law. While I enjoy learning new things, I love seeing what I can develop and the ideas that come from working with new code. I have accepted a job working with the Sony Corporation of America and an excited to start in June.

							My program was developed in the Java programming language, using the eclipse IDE. I used the TarsosDSP and JavaSound API in order to develop my application. Currently the program requires downloading the file contents and running them on a local IDE but soon will be able to run using an executable JAR file. As previously stated it works with both the built in mic and the line-in audio input. The file paths are relative to the java project so it is not hardcoded to my machine. The files below are my entire design process.
