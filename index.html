						The Artificial Instructor is a program designed to help people learn how to play the Bass guitar. Today people may learn to play the Bass guitar by either using a private instructor or a series of textbooks and online tutorial videos. My program aims to give the benefits of both methods of teaching by allowing feedback on the user's real time input. Using the TarsosDSP library and the JavaSound API my program is able to interpret input, compare to the lesson data, and give feedback on attempts.
